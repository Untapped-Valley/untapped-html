The html based website being made is for a business-tech organization called Untapped Valley.

Untapped is a business-tech orientated not-for-profit organization that is federally backed by the government of Canada. Untapped operates beyond Canada into a worldwide market consisting of the United States and United Kingdom and beyond in the future. 

Our mission is to delve into the market of young and brilliant entrepreneurial minds, the innovators of the future, whilst providing them with an elite support system from grants to our Untapped Incubation Bank (UIB). The origins of Untapped came from the basis of what is seen in the entrepreneurial capitals of the world, Silicon Valley, New York, Chicago, Toronto, and more. 

With this, we hope to pave the way for a future generation of entrepreneurs to get their business-tech out there; build their network, understand the inner-workings of corporate dealings, all for a better tomorrow, “because businesses don’t create value, but the people do: now that’s revolutionary.”
